IN MIA (M.Tech Integrated CSE with Specialization in Business Analytics)

This project is based on SDG Goal 8 – “Decent Work and Economic Growth,” 
focusing on employee attrition and workplace satisfaction. Using the IBM 
Watson Employee dataset, we aim to uncover patterns and drivers behind 
why employees leave organizations. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was 
applied to visualize data distributions, identify key variables, and detect 
patterns that influence attrition. The purpose of this study is to help 
businesses retain employees by understanding underlying data-driven 
insights.
